NATS event schema for the B1 event-bus surface.

§11.4 of the contract design (and the §11.2 audit vocabulary it
extends) reserves these subject names for KAI-C's broadcast surface
so monitoring apps can subscribe instead of polling. A subscribed
client gets every inference result in real time without making its
own KAI-C call — one adapter inference fans out to N consumers, GPU
load drops N×.

Subject naming convention
-------------------------

::

    opennvr.inference.{adapter}.{camera_id}.completed

* ``adapter``    — adapter name as registered with KAI-C (yolov8,
                   piper-tts, whisper-asr, …).
* ``camera_id``  — operator-supplied camera identifier. The literal
                   string ``unknown`` is used when KAI-C couldn't
                   derive one from the request payload (e.g.,
                   conformance probes).

Subscribers can use NATS wildcards:

* ``opennvr.inference.>``               — every inference event
* ``opennvr.inference.yolov8.>``        — YOLOv8 results only
* ``opennvr.inference.*.cam-front.>``   — every adapter, one camera

Schema is JSON over the wire — human-debuggable, no codegen needed,
~1 KB per event for typical detection results. Subscribers consume
via the ``opennvr-inference-listener`` example (or roll their own;
see ``examples/inference-listener/README.md`` for the 30-line
template).

Failure mode
------------

Publishing is best-effort. If the NATS broker is down or the publish
times out, KAI-C logs a warning and continues — the HTTP/WS request
path is NEVER blocked by the publisher. Subscribers see a gap in
the event stream; KAI-C's audit log still has the full record (so
the audit guarantee §11.2 makes is unchanged). When the broker
comes back, publishing resumes for new inferences; we do not replay
the gap. Replay is a separate event-store concern (see §B2 in the
design doc roadmap).
