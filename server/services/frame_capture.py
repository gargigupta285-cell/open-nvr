"""
Persistent per-camera RTSP capture pool.

Why this exists
---------------
The original inference path opened a *fresh* ``cv2.VideoCapture(rtsp_url)``
for every single frame, read one frame, and released it. Opening an RTSP
session is expensive: a TCP connect, the RTSP DESCRIBE / SETUP / PLAY
handshake, and then a wait for the first decodable keyframe — on H.264
with a 1-2 second GOP that is hundreds of milliseconds to ~2 seconds of
setup latency *per inference*. It also wrote each frame to disk
(``latest.jpg``) for the adapter to read back over a shared volume.

This pool keeps **one long-lived capture open per camera**, reuses it
across calls, and returns **JPEG bytes in memory** (no disk round-trip).
A capture that starts failing is transparently reopened. The result is
that steady-state frame grabs cost a single ``grab()/retrieve()`` plus a
JPEG encode, not a full reconnect.

Thread-safety
-------------
One lock per camera guards that camera's capture object, so concurrent
inference loops for *different* cameras never block each other, while two
calls for the *same* camera serialise (a single OpenCV capture is not
safe to read from two threads at once). The pool dict itself is guarded
by a short-held lock only while looking up / creating the per-camera
entry.

Testability
----------
``cv2`` is reached only through an injectable ``capture_factory`` /
``encode_jpeg`` so the pool can be unit-tested with fakes — no real RTSP
stream or OpenCV build required.
